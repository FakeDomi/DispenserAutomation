# Dispenser Automation

Automate everything!* Make dispensers do many of the previously player-only tasks like placing saplings, breaking obsidian or using buckets on cauldrons.

This server side mod allows dispensers to use items and place blocks when they are touching a smithing table on any side (see featured screenshot).

When touching a stone cutter, dispensers will instead break the block in front using the tools inside their inventory. They will refuse to use tools that are about to break if those are enchanted with mending.
